## About Me

I am a Master’s student in AI for Science at the National University of Singapore, with a background in Software Engineering. My academic training focuses on machine learning and data science, particularly representation learning for structured and temporal data, graph neural networks, and LLM-centered data systems such as retrieval-augmented generation and evaluation frameworks.

I‘m currently seeking PhD or Research Assistant positions in machine learning and data science, where I aim to pursue methodological research with an emphasis on rigor, interpretability, and real-world relevance. I would be glad to discuss potential opportunities if my background aligns with your research interests.

## Education Background

- **Beihang University** (School of Software), Bachelor of Engineering in Software Engineering, 2020.09-2025.07
- **National University of Singapore** (Faculty of Science, Department of Physics), Master of Science in AI for Science, 2025.08-Present

## Research & Competition

- **Digital Twin Based Intelligent Networked Vehicle Event Data Recorder Manufacture** — State Key Laboratory of Software Development Environment, Beihang University, 2021.09-2022.01  
  - Co-authored a study on digital twin–based manufacturing for intelligent vehicle event data recorders (EDR/DSSAD).
  - Designed a system-level architecture integrating sensor data, CAN networks, and digital twin models for accident data recording and reconstruction.
  - Evaluated vehicle and autonomous driving data pipelines to support safety analysis, regulatory compliance, and intelligent manufacturing workflows.

- **Real-Time Battery Fault Early Warning Using CPS-Integrated LSTM/BPNN for Electric Vehicle Power Batteries** — Beihang University, 2023.8-2024.9  
  - Developed a cyber-physical system–based real-time fault early warning framework for onboard EV power batteries under varying environmental conditions.
  - Applied LSTM and BPNN to predict battery temperature dynamics and enable a self-updating adaptive battery model.
  - Validated on real-world electric bus data, achieving 57s earlier fault warnings, 11.1% lower misdiagnosis, and 8.4% reduced diagnostic failures.

- **NutriVLM: Optimizing Multimodal Models for Comprehensive Nutritional Assessment** — Artificial Intelligence Innovation Center, Hangzhou International Innovation Institution of Beihang University, 2024.07-2024.10  
  - Proposed NutriVLM, a task-specific evaluation framework for multimodal food understanding, covering food type, weight, and nutritional estimation.
  - Constructed a high-quality annotated real-food image dataset (5,000+ images, 10 categories) and benchmarked state-of-the-art vision–language models.
  - Designed a multi-round prompt optimization strategy, achieving consistent improvements in overall nutritional assessment accuracy.
  
- **GNNs for Understanding Criticality and Emergent Complexity in Cellular Automata** — Department of Physics, National University of Singapore, 2025.08-Present  
  - Reformulated cellular automata dynamics as graph-structured data, enabling the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) instead of brute-force simulation.
  - Designed and implemented multiple graph constructions (e.g. state transition graphs and dependency graphs) and converted them into PyTorch Geometric datasets with consistent node and edge semantics.
  - Built an automated pipeline to generate, validate, and serialize large graph datasets, supporting supervised learning with rule-level labels and handcrafted features.

- **NUSKAKI: Retrieval-Augmented QA System** — Coursework, National University of Singapore, 2025.08-2025.11  
  - Designed a modular RAG architecture separating knowledge construction, retrieval, generation, and evaluation, enabling reproducible comparison across lightweight local LLMs.
  - Built a domain-specific semantic retrieval pipeline and analyzed retrieval quality as a system-level bottleneck affecting downstream reasoning.
  - Developed a question-type–aware evaluation framework and conducted controlled experiments to reveal model capacity vs. grounding trade-offs and reasoning failure modes.
